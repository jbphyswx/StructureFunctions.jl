"""
Consider using some sort of Intervals thingy for the intervals
    worked on arrays of size 1e4 in 12 seconds, was about a true half and half timewise, so w/ saved bins would be about 6 seconds...
    note we still need to turn values to vectors for u,v,w, etc and have a function for the SF calculation that's not just order...
    and we need a parallel version, maybe parallelize over the `i` loop, aggregate the results separately, then bin and average from the workers...
    - probably shouldn't use sharedarrays as those can possibly fail w/ concurrent reads/writes

    parallel version took 4 seconds, 2 for bin calculation, 2 for SF w/ 5 workers (was 12 w/o parallel so 3x speedup)
